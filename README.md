UPDATED SDR CODE - DEEP INTEGRATION

Work has been done to implement deep integration within the Matlab SDR code framework. This is based on the work of Dr. Sihao Zhao & Sara Powell and was presented at the Institute of Navigation GNSS+ 2014 meeting. For those interesting in exploring this topic, the additional/modified files to work with this from within the original SDR code can be found here.
